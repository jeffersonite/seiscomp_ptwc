This repo contains configurations in the etc and share directories within the seiscomp file structure.

Typical use would be to clone the repo as a blank @ROOTDIR@ (e.g., "git clone /home/sysop/seiscomp"), then expand the seiscomp-compiled tarball or compile sesicomp from source as the @ROOTDIR@. Standard seiscomp installations or updates should not overwrite the tracked files in the repo.
